    <p>This force-directed graph shows the acceptance of reposts from one
    subreddit to another. Upvotes on reposts causes links between nodes to turn
    green, while an overall number of downvotes causes the link color to turn
    red. Larger nodes have more original submissions than smaller nodes.
    Nodes receptive to reposts are colored green while those that downvote
    reposts are colored red. So in order to maximum the karma you get from
    reposts, you'll want to search the larger subreddits for content, while
    reposting to subreddits that are both bright green and connected to the
    original subreddit.</p>
    <p>If a node is green but has a red link color, the node is receptive to
    reposts, but original submissions from that subreddit don't repost well to
    other subreddits.</p>
    <p>The graph shows that the funny &amp; pics are the largest creators of
    original content, which many subreddits feed off of without creating
    content that is reposted anywhere. There are many subreddits highly
    receptive of reposts originating from these two subreddits, such as
    spaceporn, chemicalreactiongifs, LifeProTips, HistoryPorn and technology.
    There are also subreddits to avoid if you're reposting something from funny
    or pics, such as ShittyPhotoshop, mspaintbattles, gaymers,
    NobodyCaresApostolate and ForeverAlone.</p>
    <p>The graph shows that funny and pics are the only link to many
    subreddits. These gravitate towards the outside of the graph. Subreddits
    which get reposts from both funny AND pics end up between the two nodes,
    like 4chan, arresteddevelopment, WTF, GIFS, Music and StarWars. If you
    zoom-in(by pressing Control and +) you can see a more connected network of
    subreddits that feed off of each other and pics/funny, such as
    reactiongifs, atheism, gaming, woahdude, AdviceAnimals and movies. You may
    want to increase the minimum node size to 10 and the minimum upvotes to
    10000 in order to see this better.</p>
    <p>The data was obtained from 
    <a target='_blank' href='http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Reddit.html'>Stanford's SNAP</a>.
    A subset of the data can be selected manually by modifying the minimum
    upvotes and downvotes required for a link to be included.
